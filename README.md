# ePlant, an email notifier that warns you if your plant needs water.
# Most common reasons hoousehold plants die are related to constant high humidity levels.
# Light conditions in households arent as good as in a greenhouse, making photosynthesis harder and, conconsequently, harder for the roots to absorb all the water
# This inspires the growth of bacteria that leads to so called "root rot" and kills your plant by killing the roots.
